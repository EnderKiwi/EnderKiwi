ROAD ROLLER!

## C
The one I know best. One of the closest languages to the hardware. Super fast.

## JavaScript
I know this one almost as much as C. It's not that close to the hardware, but it runs on almost any device you can think of with the only requirement being a browser.

## Java
My inspiration for learning how to program. Minecraft: Java Edition led me to learn Java, which I still struggle with to this day (half joke). Very verbose, very cross platform, very interesting.

## Python
Very easy. It's a slow programming language that I had to learn in school.
